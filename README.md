# 🏄‍♂️ Oskaroo
**Full-Stack Developer (.NET / React)**

Hi! I'm Oskar — a backend-focused full-stack developer building **production-grade web applications**.  
I work mainly with **.NET, ASP.NET Web API, EF Core, PostgreSQL**, and **React**, delivering systems used in real business environments.

My work is strongly domain-driven — I work close to systems such as **Transport Management Systems (TMS)** and **ERP-like internal platforms**, where business logic, data consistency, and correctness really matter.

## 🧪 Side Projects & Ongoing Learning
Alongside my professional work, I actively develop **private side projects** to deepen my understanding of technologies I don’t use daily in my current role.

I currently focus on:
- containerization and deployment concepts (Docker)
- microservices architecture
- basic Kubernetes concepts
- system design and scalability considerations
